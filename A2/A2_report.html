			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>How has the value of homes changed over time?</li>
				<p>
					Everyone knows that home values have generally increased over time, I want
					to use this question to look at and validate that the data makes sense and matches
					our intution. Will we see the great recession appear?
				</p>
				<li>Are all homes being bought in the same neighborhoods?</li>
				<p>
					I read the Homes for Profit article. I am curious 
					if we will see that most homes bought to be flipped are in the
					same neighborhoods. I know that most are BIPOC but would like to confirm
					that geographically these are all colocated
				</p>
				<li>Are the same homes flipped over and over?</li>
				<p>
					I lived in New York before Boston, and I noticed that a few buildings
					seemed to be flipped and sold a few times in just a few years. I wonder if
					the same homes in Boston are being invested in and flipped or if this is a 
					one and done process
				</p>
				<li>Are gentrifying neighborhoods experiencing a lot of flips?</li>
				<p>
					I grew up in Boston so I am familiar with the neighborhood known as Southie.
					Growing up, this was a tough area, but has become full of young professionals recently.
					Income is increasing, migration is happening, and so it is probably considered a good place to invest. Are 
					investments coming in here and are we seeing a lot of flipping as a result?
				</p>
				<li>What does the cash discount look like?</li>
				<p>
					The Homes for profit article mentioned that investors are paying less in cash than someone would 
					pay with a loan. This means that investors can undercut homeowners by paying in cash and
					end up paying less for the property than listed price. How much less?
					Are all investors paying in cash or just large institutions?

			<h2>Discoveries & Insights</h2>
			<h2>Question 1: How has the value of homes changed over time?</h2>
			<p>
				We start by addressing question 1, how do home values look over time to get a general sense of the data. 
				I start with both average annual value and previous sales price to compare both. **I had ChatGPT explain to me 
				what average annual value meant and why it might be useful as I found this concept not intuitive.**
				It turns out that average annual value more or less represents average dollar volume per year and more accurately
				reflects market activity than average home price. Also note that I came back and created the same graph with price, I found
				this tracked almost perfectly with previous sales price, all the same trends were visible.
			</p>
			<figure>
				<img src="Images/valuesovertime.png" alt="Average annual value and prev sales price over time" />
				<figcaption>
					Average annual value and previous sales price both increase over time
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				We see that average annual value does not show
				any decline in market activity due to the great recession, which is concerning to me. This could indicate that houses
				were still being bought by investors. We see a big trend upwards in the average of previous house sales price. Notably,
				the recession is captured by previous sales prices, so houses were being sold at a discount. Perhaps more houses were being
				bought up in this discount and that explains the discrepancy. We also see a drop in previous sales price after COVID which
				aligns with my expectations of the dataset. My biggest takeaway was why is there such a huge increase in average value in 2017?
				This represents a ton of market activity in 2017 or maybe a huge transaction. 
			</p>

				<img src="Images/amount_discrep_by_type.png" alt="Average annual value discrepancy by investor type" />
				<figcaption>
				Average annual value by investor type with outlier point indicated
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				What we see here is pretty interesting, volatility in average value by investor type is 
				almost solely coming from institutional investments. I am going to dive into what might have caused this.
			</p>
			<figure>
				<img src="Images/avgannualissue.png" alt="2017 issue values" />
				<figcaption>
				Largest average annual value properties for institutional investors in 2017
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				This looks to me like a data issue! We see all institutional values here, and their addresses notably each until
				at 160 federal st has a value of 130 million. This can't be correct or i am wrongly interpreting the value and 
				average annual value marks the whole transaction. Each individual unit probably should not be priced like this. I wanted 
				to explore average annual value earlier, but for the rest of the exploration will stick to sale price as it is easier to
				interpret. 
			</p>
			<figure>
				<img src="Images/lastsaleprice.png" alt="last sale price over time" />
				<figcaption>
				We see the sale price of each property filtered for institutions in 2017 over 150 million
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				This confirms that each unit is priced super high. I googled these units actually to verify and it seems
				this transaction is potentially duplicated. I will now move on to look at my second question, are all homes being bought
				in the same neighborhood? In order to remove these potentially faulty units, the rest of my exploration will focus on
				residential and family homes, not commercial properties.
			</p>
			<h2>Question 2: Are all homes being bought in the same neighborhoods?</h2>

			<figure>
				<img src="Images/zipcodes.png" alt="zipcode of each sale" />
				<figcaption>
				Each transaction sorted by zipcode. Color represents amount of transactions.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				Immediately what we see here is there are too many zipcodes, one outlier south and a few zipcodes that are just
				dots. I did some googling and discovered the some of the dots are valid zipcodes but others are just commercial
				property specific groups. I remove the outlier and commercial property sales as I would like to focus on residential
				properties, this includes condos, single family homes, etc...
			</p>

			<figure>
				<img src="Images/homesalesspread.png" alt="Amount of homes sold and average price" />
				<figcaption>
					Amount of homes sold and average sale price across Boston
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				I did a bit of cleaning here, I grouped a few zip codes together to improve visibility, I removed outlier areas,
				if only one or two homes was sold etc, and I left only residential properties. The results are fascinating to me and
				not what I expected as someone who grew up in the area. Southie and seaport had almost no sales recorded. 
				Both of these neighborhoods have undergone tremendous change in the past twenty years. With Seaport the results are okay
				because almost every change there has been commmercial. I will now try to look into Southie and why it has no sales...Note
				also that in this screenshot I was playing around with a construction year filter that had no impact on the result. I found 
				that year is accurate and yearbuilt can have outlier values.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is pretty evident that most of the investment in residential properties is happening in downtown, north end,
				and backbay neighborhoods. The more western neighborhoods are seeing less residential property sales. This is pretty
				expected I would say, I think most of the housing really in boston is in these neighborhoods where we see the most
				sales. The average price interestingly, is closer between neighborhoods than I thought it would be. I want to move onto
				my next question, lets start by looking at the types of sellers we see.
			</p>




			<h2>Question 3: Who is selling houses?</h2>
			<figure>
				<img src="Images/sellerinfo.png" alt="seller info categories" />
				<figcaption>
				Amount of different types of sellers seen in the market over time
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				I started by graphing all the seller metrics over time to see what market trends might be
				happening. What i see here is that there aren't any null years listed which is a good sign.
				All the data looks pretty clean. What is really interesting is the sell side flip
				value is close to 0 until 2010 and then skyrockets. Either people started flipping more because of the recession
				or some sort of flipping law changed or flipping just became more popular than building new.
				I am not too worried that there are errors here in the data, everything seems pretty well
				filled in. I am going to try to figure out who is does this flipping.
			</p>

				<img src="Images/investortype.png" alt="type of investor buying flipped properties" />

				</figcaption>
			</figure>
				<p>
					We see interestingly that non investors are selling the majority of flipped properties.
					I guess this actually makes sense, most people buying flipped apartments are just normal
					people looking to live. When we flip this and see what people are selling flipped properties,
					that graph looks almosy exactly the same as this one... That to me is more interesting, I 
					would have thought investors would be selling these flipped properties. Lets make sure that
					non investors are actually all who we think they are. I will drill into the non investor category.
				</p>
			<figure>
				<img src="Images/bubblenoninvbuys.png" alt="Property purchases by non investors" />
				<figcaption>
				Property purchases by non investors are primarily condominiums
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
				<p>
					What we see here is that most non investor sales are condominiums or residential (gray and blue),
					this confirms that we are seeing what we want here. There are a few outliers, such as a single live theatre
					purchase, but none of these are ridculously large compared to the home prices, and they are very limited in amount. The results
					we see here are what we expected, these are noninvestors buying properties and selling them. I think the downside
					of flipping is you are essentially taking up housing someone else could use for a while. I am curious what
					the horizon is on these flips? Are these flips that people are doing taking up a lot of housing?
				</p>


			<h2>Question 4: Are these non-investors flipping quickly?</h2>
			<p>
				The pie chart below describes the timelines of the different noninvestor flips. The 0 for non flips makes sense, because
				we already filtered to flippers selling. We see the majority of flips are taking 12-24 months! This means that the decisions
				these non investors are making to flip houses is taking up housing for a really long amount of time. around 600/900 total flips
				by non investors are taking this long. This means 1-2 years that a condo or apartment is off the market and unliveable.
			</p>

			<h2>Question 5: Who is buying houses?</h2>

			<p>
				Looking back at my research so far, I think I skipped a bit over who is actually doing all the buying. I found the potential
				data error with commercial properties, but I want to understand the breakdown of buyers for residential properties more. I understand
				that non investors are almost solely buying these properties, but are they making up the majority of purchasers?
			</p>

			<figure>
				<img src="Images/resinvestors.png" alt="residential investor types" />
				<figcaption>
				Non investors make up the vast majority of residential property buyer
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Thankfully, we still live in a world where non investors are buying the majority of residential buildings. People are buying
				their own homes, or buying houses to flip (probably better than this being done at commercial scale). I am a bit skeptical that
				this is static over time, given we hear how people cannot afford houses anymore. Let us take a further look
				at the investor portfolio.
			</p>

			<figure>
				<img src="images/investortypetime.png" alt="investor type over time" />
				<figcaption>
				The percent of residential properties purchased by non investors is decreasing over time.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				We can clearly make out in this figure that the percent of properties being bought by non investors is dropping over
				time. We see the steepest decline occur in the years following the great recession. There is a uptrend post COVID, but
				this is probably not likely to stay. I recall hearing about so many peple buying a house post covid because home mortgage
				rates were low but this has subsided in recent years. Most of the investor uptick can be accounted for by small investors.
				**As a side note, ChatGPT aided me in creating this plot, showing me how to selectively mark and suggesting
				a switch to address count as a unique property identifier. (Although I looked at row count from Tableau 
				side by side and amounts were exactly the same)
			</p>
			<p>
				This finding, that non investors are buying less of the properties over time is consistent with what we see in articles
				about the housing crisis. Investors are coming in and raising rents on families. The article I read described homes being
				bought more and more away from BIPOC families by investors and this graphic really seems to support that point with evidence.
			</p>


			<h2>Additional EDA/cleaning issues</h2>
			<figure>
				<img src="Images/yearbuilt.png" alt="yearbuilt outliers" />
				<figcaption>
				Outliers found in the yearbuilt category
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>I wanted to note an outlier set I found that did not impact any of my research questions. I found that yearbuilt
				was 0 for 1200 of the residential properties. I found this while just investigating around for data issues. The year
				data was full and clean for every sales transaction.

			<h2>Summary</h2>

			<p>
				In this EDA exercise, we explored a property sales dataset. We started with understanding market trends
				and value over time. We then dug into where homes are being sold and who is selling. We found most homes
				are being sold in the same neighborhoods for pretty similar prices. We looked at property flipping
				from investors and non investors. We found that noninvestors are doing most of the home flipping
				and that these flips are taking 1-2 years to complete. Finally, we looked at who is buying houses 
				and some trends we see in this over time. We find that investors are buying more houses over time and
				non investor purchases are dropping.
